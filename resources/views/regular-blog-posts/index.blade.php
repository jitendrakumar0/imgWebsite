                  <div class="col-12 text-start fw-600 fs-md-16 fs-sm-15 fs-14 text-white mt-2">If you ever happen upon a website that you realize hasn’t been updated in years, you probably immediately lose some trust in the information you’re seeing. The company it represents could have gone out of business completely or the website could be providing information that’s been completely debunked or changed since that last update. Even Google doesn’t want to deliver its searchers outdated information. Websites that are regularly updated signal to them that the website is alive and thus Google put them to top rather than old content websites. Keeping your website fresh and updated is a key to a successful SEO Campaign.

                  <div class="col-12 text-start fw-600 fs-md-16 fs-sm-15 fs-14 text-white mt-2">If someone who does a search clicks on the first link, then finds it unhelpful and immediately leaves to go back to the search page – that tells Google that the first result wasn’t as helpful as they thought. On the other hand, when someone clicks on a result and stays on the website for a while, that signals to Google that this website is actually very helpful. Blogging is surely an important tool in ranking factor. Keeping customers longer on your website is a way to keep you on top searches.

                  <div class="col-12 text-start fw-600 fs-md-16 fs-sm-15 fs-14 text-white mt-2">These are called long-tail keywords and they’re extremely important for any SEO strategy – half of all searches are for terms that are four words or longer. But they can be awkward to try to fit into your product pages. However, they’re the perfect kind of terms to target in a blog post. The long tail keywords can be easily put to use in a blog and they would not seem irrelevant there. On the other hand of the same are used on product pages, these keywords would pop out in an ugly manner and make your website look ugly.

                  <div class="col-12 text-start fw-600 fs-md-16 fs-sm-15 fs-14 text-white mt-2">While you can probably find some good internal linking possibilities on the main pages of your website, once you start publishing blog posts, the opportunities will really blossom. As you add more pages on various but related topics, you add more opportunities to naturally link those pages to each other. You can put links to different products and services you offer in the blog and make it easier for customers to surf in your website.

                  <div class="col-12 text-start fw-600 fs-md-16 fs-sm-15 fs-14 text-white mt-2">When your audience reads a post they love, they’re more likely to share it, drive more traffic to it and come back to your website again to see more of your content and maybe even sign up for your email list. When you get lots of traffic and repeat visitors, that shows Google that people like your website and raises your authority level in their algorithm. A blog is a good way to make those connections and start a continued relationship with the people you want to reach.
